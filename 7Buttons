#lang racket/gui

; A GUI guessing game

;Defining the window (i.e. frame)
(define f (new frame% [label "Christoph Woninski"]))
;n is defined as a random number less in value and not equal to the given integer
(define n (random 7))
;This is the part that actually launches the "Christoph Woninski" window
(send f show #t)
;*check i* is a button event; so when a button is pressed, i (the integer) will be checked
;and if i is equal to n (the random number) then "Yes" will be displayed in the "Was I correct"
;message box
(define ((check i) btn evt)
  (message-box "Was I correct?" (if (= i n) "Yes" "No")))

(for ([i (in-range 8)])
  (make-object button% (format "~A" i) f (check i)))

;lets do the thing!!!!
;i am lost
;why am i here
;in programming class????????????????????????

;define a variable that encompasses the same range of integers as the "make-object button" crap, 
;then us int->string to change those integers into their respective letters

(define s
  
  int->string
  
   (display
   (integer->char
    (+ i (char->integer #\α)))))


;wooo
(for ([i (in-range 8)])
(make-object button%  
     (format "Button ~a:" s) f (check i)))

(for ([s (in-range 8)])
  (display
   (integer->char
    (+ i (char->integer #\α)))))

    ;(format "~a" i) f (check i)))
